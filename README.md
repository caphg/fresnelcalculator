Tool for calculating radiowaves diffraction with a real world data models


Many natural phenomenas have a direct impact on radio propagation and communication in real conditions. The discussed topic was about diffraction based on the ITU-R P.526-12 recommendation. In order to gain insight into quality of a communication channel, many independent measurements and simulations are to be made before implementing a solution. After this procedure, transmitting and receiving antenas are put on best known locations and route is being carefully planned. To simplify the process, tool has been made to simulate propagation with genuine terrain data. Data was acquired from NASA`s web pages during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission which took place in February 2000. on the shuttle Endeavour. In the meanwhile, data was reviewed several times and the current version that was used in this application was SRTM3. Exact calculations of natural phenomenas are immpossible to implement and approximations are being used for that purpose. These approximations are enough relevant to get insight into terrains regularities but further measurements need to be conducted before building the project.
